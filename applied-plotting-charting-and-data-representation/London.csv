"In order to protect against disclosure of personal information, records have been swapped between different geographic areas. Some counts will be affected, particularly small counts at the lowest geographies.",,,,,,,,,,
"The voluntary question on religion in the 2011 Census was intended to capture people's religious affiliation and identification at the time of the Census irrespective of whether they practised or believed in that religion or how important it was in their lives. If a person had no religion then the first of a series of tick boxes could be selected. Care should be taken when using these data not to infer, or allow the inference by others, that the practice of a religion or specific religious activities that are expected of believers has been measured. Unlike other census questions where missing answers are imputed, this question was voluntary, and where no answer was provided the response is categorised as 'not stated'.",,,,,,,,,,
"Due to an error in the processing of census data, the number of usual residents in the 'Religion not stated' category has been overestimated by a total of 62,000 for three local authorities: Camden, Islington and Tower Hamlets.
